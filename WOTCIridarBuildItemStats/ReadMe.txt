[WOTC] Item Stats in Engineering

A small quality of life mod that lets you view item's stats on the Build Items screen in Engineering. Especially helpful if you use a lot of mods that add new items.

To view item stats, click the small [b]"Info" button[/b] at the bottom of the screen.

If you would like to always see item stats by default, set [b]bDisplayStats = true[/b] in this mod's configuration file.

[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]

Safe to add or remove mid-campaign, including mid-tactical.
